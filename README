
String::OrderedCombination - An algorithm to calculate all the strings resulting from an ordered 
combination of k characters from n characters available.


PREREQUISITES

This suite requires Perl 5; I tested it only under Perl 5.8.

String::Combination requires the Test module.

A C compiler.


INSTALLATION

You install String::Combination by running these commands in the *nix environment:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test (optional)
   make install

To install String::Combination in the Win32 environment, use nmake instead of make.
nmake is available for free (in a self extracting executable):
<http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/Nmake15.exe>
After download and inflate, put nmake.exe and nmake.err in c:\windows\command .
You need also a C compiler (e.g. Visual C++).

POD format documentation is included in Combination.pm.  
POD is readable with the command:
